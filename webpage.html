			Mountains are majestic landforms that rise prominently above the surrounding terrain, 
			creating awe-inspiring vistas and serving as natural landmarks.
			These colossal formations are often characterized by steep slopes, towering peaks, 
			and breathtaking landscapes. Mountains can be found on every continent, and
			they play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's topography. They are the result of tectonic
			 forces causing the Earth's crust to fold, uplift, and in some cases, erupt in volcanic 
			 activity.This geologic process over millions of years has given rise to diverse mountain ranges, 
			 each with its unique geological features and ecological niches.
